A Python library to convert standard format time to a plain language representation accurate to 5, 10, or 15 minute increments of an hour.  The primary motivation for this library is to create fuzzy clock plugins for tmux and the i3 window manager.

This library is currently under development.  I intend to eventually complete documentation and publish to PyPi.
